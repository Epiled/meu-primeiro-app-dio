    <string name="txt">Did you know that the web browser Firefox, developed by Mozilla, was named after a fire-related nickname? The red panda, native to the Himalayan mountains, is known as "firefox" in English. The name was chosen for the browser due to the red panda\'s resemblance to the browser\'s logo and to evoke the idea of speed and agility associated with the browser\'s performance.</string>
